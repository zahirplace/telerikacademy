            How do they differ from C#?
             */

            /*
            Java - software developed in Java run on any other operating system. Java has very rich re-usable libraries.
                  Object Oriented Language, is the adopted language in the development of Android Operating System that has become common in Cell phones.
             
             C - a procedural language that is extremely fast compared to Java. 
                 What makes C to be fast is its need to be compiled to run on specific environments other than where the program was initially developed.
                 It has been used widely in production of device drivers, system software and business applications. 
             
             C++ - it was initial aimed to be an update for C language, but later became popular and today C++ has been used to develop 
                  most business applications, system software, High performance servers, simulations and games.C++ has the same speed factor as in C language.
             
             Python - One of the popular programming languages in cloud computing. Python is a general purpose language with usage in multiple industries and 
                    has been used in Web and Cloud applications on different frameworks.
             
             Ruby - a business oriented language. Ruby has been used in development of applications such as Web and Cloud applications, simulations, 3D modeling and Robotics.
                    Everything in Ruby is an object, but it is a slow language.
             
             
             C# - a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing imperative, functional, generic, object-oriented and 
                component-oriented programming disciplines.
              
             C# lets programmers write entirely bug-free programs.
             C# duplicates much of the concise syntax of C and also adds modern, object-oriented features. 
             
             Advantages over C and C++
                It is compiled to an intermediate language (CIL) indepently of the language it was developed or the target architecture and operating system
                Automatic garbage collection
                Pointers no longer needed (but optional)
                Reflection capabilities
                Don't need to worry about header files ".h"
                Definition of classes and functions can be done in any order
                Declaration of functions and classes not needed
                Unexisting circular dependencies
                Classes can be defined within classes
                There are no global functions or variables, everything belongs to a class
                All the variables are initialized to their default values before being used (this is automatic by default but can be done manually using static constructors)
                You can't use non-boolean variables (integers, floats...) as conditions. This is much more clean and less error prone
                Apps can be executed within a restricted sandbox

            Advantages over C++ and Java
                Formalized concept of get-set methods, so the code becomes more legible
                More clean events management (using delegates)

            Advantages over Java
                Usually it is much more efficient than java and runs faster
                CIL (Common (.NET) Intermediate Language) is a standard language, while java bytecodes aren't
                It has more primitive types (value types), including unsigned numeric types
                Indexers let you access objects as if they were arrays
                Conditional compilation
                Simplified multithreading
                Operator overloading. It can make development a bit trickier but they are optional and sometimes very useful
                (limited) use of pointers if you really need them, as when calling unmanaged (native) libraries which doesn't run on top of the virtual machine (CLR)

              
              //================== ======================== =======================
                           
             - C# е препоръчваният език за програмиране за .NET Framework. Архитектите на езика специално са го проектирали за .NET Framework и 
               са го съобразили с особеностите на платформата още по време на дизайна. C# наследява простотата на Java, мощността на C++ и силните черти на Delphi. 
               Той притежава максимално стегнат и ясен синтаксис.
             - В България C# е най-популярният от .NET езиците и се използва най-масово в българските софтуерни компании.
             - C# е от семейството на C-базираните езици и синтактично много прилича на Java, C++, C и PHP. Много хора, които не знаят езика, 
               биха разбрали примерите без особени усилия.
             - За C# има повече статии в специализираните сайтове и лични днев-ници (blogs) в Интернет. Общността на C# разработчиците е по-добре развита, 
               отколкото на разработчиците на другите .NET езици.
             - Поради голямата популярност на езика C# за него има по-добра поддръжка от инструментите за разработка.
             - Езици като C++, Visual Basic и JScript не са проектирани специално за .NET Framework, а са адаптирани допълнително към него чрез редица изменения и 
               добавки. В следствие на това те запазват някои синтактични особености, които не са удобни при работата с .NET.
